To get an accurate simulation, I've found two optimal solutions:<br><li>Find an schematic and re-implement the processing with complicated matrix calculus. This is quite tedious and I'm leaving it for the future.</li><li>Capture the processed sound of the pedal to train an LSTM model in order to do the heavy work for me.

The images are acquired by transmitting electromagnetic pulses (in the C-band frequency) in vertical polarization and receiving simultaneously in vertical and horizontal polarization. Therefore, two polarimetric combinations or channels are measured: VV and VH.<br><br>The PAZ satellite has a smaller coverage (up to 100km) and sends images to Earth every 11 days. Although the temporal resolution is lower than that provided by the Sentinel-1 satellites, these images have a considerably higher spatial resolution.
